Project - TutoringApp


Scope

This project aims to create a tutoring application from end-to-end. This 
application is for a company that provides tutoring services for students to 
recieve one-on-one private tutoring, or group tutoring sessions from the tutor 
employees of the company. The main views of the application are: Tutor, 
Manager, Student, and General. In this project, we implement the Manager view, 
where managers are responsible for various tasks such as verifying a tutor, 
removing students, removing evaluation comments, booking rooms for group 
sessions, etc.
